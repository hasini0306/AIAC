        "\n",
        "*   The initial Python code successfully implemented a function `is_armstrong_number` that correctly identifies Armstrong numbers by converting the number to a string, iterating through digits, and calculating the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.\n",
        "*   The modified code improved the `is_armstrong_number` function by using mathematical operations (modulo and integer division) for digit extraction, which can be more performant for very large numbers compared to string conversion.\n",
        "*   The modified code also added handling for negative numbers by working with the absolute value during digit extraction and introduced the use of `math.log10` for potentially more efficient digit counting for larger numbers.\n",
        "*   A new variable `original_number` was introduced in the modified code to preserve the original value of the input number for the final comparison, as the `temp_number` is altered during the digit extraction process.\n",
        "*   The example usage in the modified code was updated to include a negative number (`-153`) to demonstrate the function's handling of such cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The modification from string manipulation to mathematical operations provides a more robust and potentially more performant solution, especially for handling very large numbers.\n",
        "*   Future steps could involve benchmarking the two versions of the `is_armstrong_number` function with a range of inputs to quantify the performance improvement, particularly for very large numbers.\n"
