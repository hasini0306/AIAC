        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The initial vague prompt \"Generate python code to calculate power bill\" resulted in a very basic linear calculation (`kwh_consumed * rate_per_kwh`) that did not account for common complexities like tiered rates, fixed charges, taxes, or time-of-use rates.\n",
        "*   Refining the prompt to specifically include inputs like total kWh consumed and cost per kWh led to code that performed a more directed single-rate calculation and added basic input validation for non-negative values.\n",
        "*   Further refining the prompt to include details about a fixed monthly service charge and a two-tier rate structure resulted in a more sophisticated function (`calculate_power_bill_tiered`) that accurately calculates bills by adding the fixed charge and applying different rates based on consumption thresholds.\n",
        "*   The tiered calculation logic correctly handles scenarios where consumption is within the first tier and where it crosses into the second tier, as demonstrated by example calculations (e.g., 450 kWh resulting in a bill of \\$83.00 and 200 kWh resulting in a bill of \\$44.00 with specified rates and fixed charge).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Incrementally adding specific details to a prompt significantly improves the relevance and complexity of the generated code, moving from a simplistic model to one that incorporates more real-world billing factors like fixed charges and tiered rates.\n",
        "*   Future refinements could include handling additional complexities such as multiple tiers, taxes, surcharges, or time-of-use rates to build a more comprehensive power bill calculation model.\n"

        "*   Starting with a vague prompt (\"Generate a Python function for temperature conversion\") resulted in a basic function that assumed Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion, lacked input validation, and was inflexible.\n",
        "*   Refining the prompt to specify a single conversion (\"Generate a Python function to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit\") led to a function tailored for that specific conversion, including the correct formula, and introduced basic input validation.\n",
        "*   Further refining the prompt to include multiple units (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin) and error handling resulted in a more complex and versatile function (`convert_temperature_advanced`) capable of handling conversions between the three specified units and providing robust error handling for invalid inputs or units.\n",
        "*   The generated code structure in the advanced version uses an intermediate unit (Celsius) to simplify the conversion logic between multiple scales and includes explicit checks for non-numeric values and invalid unit strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Prompt specificity is crucial for generating code that precisely meets requirements, handles complex scenarios, and includes features like error handling.\n",
        "*   For more complex tasks, breaking down requirements (like multi-unit support and error handling) into clear instructions within the prompt is essential for generating robust and versatile code.\n"
